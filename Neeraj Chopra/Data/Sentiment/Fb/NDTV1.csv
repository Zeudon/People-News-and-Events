This is what the archery team should learn from him   He said he was nder no pressure as he was thinking that he had faced his competitor's earlier and was a similar game.  Our archery team perform well in world tournament but fail in Olympics always ..  This will definitely give lots of hope and confidence to the other team members to bring 20 medals next Olympic,2021-08-07T18:05:11+0000,0.167,0.099,0.734,0.7543
