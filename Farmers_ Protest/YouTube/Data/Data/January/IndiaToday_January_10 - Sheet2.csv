Traveller Life,BJP party deliberately wanted this situation so that they can divert the core issue to farm law to something else.  They did same in CAA .  Who knows some elements  are their sympathizers ?  Unless people of this country  do not support laws made are properly discussed in parliament and voted . (Voice vote for core issues are farce and cheating)  Opposition party also responsible  most of the MP are irresponsible   because of their attendance in parliament is questionable . There is zero unity with opposition too,2021-01-28T02:03:43Z,0,0,,,,

The police shot a tear gas shell in the forehead of a young protester on the tractor. He lost control of the tractor which turned upside down and the guy died on the spot. The police initiated tear gas shelling and stone pelting on protestors from a  rail bridge near ITO. The protesters had no other option but to retaliate.

,,,,,C-39-Pratham Shukla,"@Sat Biswas Lmao the people who hailed Deep Sindhu as an educated son of farmers are calling him a BJP stooge?? Really, that&#39;s the best you&#39;ve got, he was campaigning for Sunny Deol at that time that&#39;s when he went to Delhi and got the photograph taken, later after some time he publicly criticised Sunny saying that he isn&#39;t living up to the promises and what not, you can find several articles from that period, I think The Tribune wrote a thorough one, and if you go by the logic of the photograph, a lot of people get photographs with controversial people, the list has no end if I start giving you examples, regarding the permission, the govt was against it from day 1, then the farmer union leaders assured them of it along with Prashant Bhushan, they even signed an undertaking, Rakesh Tikait signed it too, well if you wanna blame the govt for trusting the protest leaders I&#39;m with you on that, and what reroute are you talking about here, have you even listened to what V M Singh has said, he said that the police thoroughly explained the route to them on several occasions, the factions led by people like Deep Sindhu from the front and Tikait from the rear deviated from the routes, are you guys really that naive, lmao<br>And about supporting the nation and what not, I&#39;m against this spineless govt from day one, those illegal squatters should&#39;ve been removed on day 1, the common citizen is very unhappy with their approach, you don&#39;t even realise that by blocking the roads you&#39;re only helping the partially incompetent govt in the centre, they&#39;re lucky to have the dumbfuck Left helping them win the elections, it&#39;s good for Modi but not good for the nation, it would&#39;ve been good for the nation if the borders wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to be occupied from the very first day due to which 70k crore loss has been incurred by the common people, enough to get a new aircraft carrier",2021-02-06T05:50:22Z,2021-02-06T05:50:22Z

SHWETA SINGH GPS CHIP WALLEEE.. CHITRA TRIPATHI.. Rohit Dangana.. All are pro government.. They will never say there is an issue with government on any matter.. They do regular Desh ka mood and give 75 percent vote to Modi Ji.. While the survey is done on 12000 people.<br>These channels help government... They have done no show on Arnab Chats..
