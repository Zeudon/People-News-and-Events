Ishpreet Kaur,"What happened that day is an expression of dissent by the farmers who have been peacefully protesting for 2 months and losing their loved ones amid cold and covid. Almost 150+ farmers died in the protest. The government passed the laws amid covid and declared postponing it just days prior to Republic Day for their reputation. They care less for the farmers and more about their image. Police clearly fired unprovoked tear gases to the peaceful protestors and the whole mess began. Thats a ground report ! Protestors were seen distributing water bottles to police and protecting female police from the chaos. Yes they hoisted their Sikh faith flag but what‚Äôs wrong with that? The National flag was way up higher and untouched and the Sikh faith flag is a reminder of the dissent of farmers who have heard zero response from their democratic prime minister about the farm law protests since day 1 as if pretending the country is well and stablilised. Guess what? The government stopped/slowed Internet services in the capital to prevent the authenticity of the day get out! <br><br><br>I would request everyone to check @sikhexpo page on Instagram.

Miss me with that stubble burning BS.<br><br>I think the length depends on the exact point you consider the start. Google first said 5 months, I apologize if that is not the length of the protest in Delhi. It is still crazy to me that the government is still fighting back against these protests. Why would a benevolent democratic government want to keep in place farming laws that the farmers don&#39;t want? You guys need to take a step back look at all of this totalitarian rhetoric and partisanship that&#39;s being spewed in support of these bills. Even Trump supporters here in America aren&#39;t openly advocating for the government to &quot;better inform the public&quot; and for intelligence agencies to do &quot;a better job preventing misinformation&quot;.",2021-01-26T20:17:48Z,2021-01-26T20:17:48Z
,,,,,Dipayan Ghosh,"‚Äã@Daniel Schmidt-Lange the protest is based on misinformation. you have to understand the bill is directed towards distribution logistics which is already messed up. Look at India like EU, each state has its own language, culture and mostly a specific god/festival (subset of all the gods if they are hindu). The govt in the 70s (might be wrong about the timeline plz fact chk) initiated MSPS (Min Support price) to encourage the cultivation of certain crops. today the country has got substantial food security and the MSP way had led to the reduction of cultivation of certain other crops which didnt have MSP. <br>the farming system itself is a little complicated since there are farmers who own the lands and then lease them to laborers for farming (this is mostly the case but not always) and when one refers to farmer suicide it is these labors who commit suicide due to debt. the new law is a revision of the existing scenario. Mostly anyone who is an expert on farming logistics will tell you it&#39;s a good law. if there is a systemic problem that arises then that can be relooked at. <br><br>when this news is reported they make it sound like all farmers are protesting, but that is not the case. the ones who are protesting are the ones who have made a substantial investment in Paddy cultivation imagining they will get a minimum support price for that. But now the needs of the country doesn&#39;t reflect the need for paddy cultivation in such large quantities. These farmers (from 2-3 states out of a total of 29 states and 7 unions) in short among other things want this minimum support price to remain. it&#39;s very illogical. they don&#39;t want to change with the changing needs. <br><br>and unlike the United States, India doesn&#39;t have access to free public education, and the mass is often manipulated for political gains, so what they are protesting for might not reflect what is in best interest. if i draw a parallel, this is like the anti-vaxer protest or the ones that didn&#39;t want to wear masks more recently.",2021-01-26T22:40:34Z,2021-01-26T22:40:34Z
,,,,,Daniel Schmidt-Lange,"@Dipayan Ghosh I did watch a video that talked about the whole market and the effects of these laws, and I fail to quite understand how deregulating the farming industry is good for farmers? The current system was definitely weird, but was deregulation the solution? <br>Really I&#39;m just here b/c I&#39;m curious and saw a sht load of totalitarian rhetoric in the comments, not to tell India how to run their country.

,,,,,Samrudhi Chaware,"1. The Farmers (Empowerment &amp; Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill: It draws a framework for contract farming agreement between farmers and buyer before sowing of a crop and for dispute settlement prescribes three level mechanisms ‚Äì the conciliation board, sub-divisional magistrate and appellate authority. However, the points of contention are:<br><br><br> a) Under this law it‚Äôs not mandatory for a company to make a written contract with the farmer for any contract farming. So, even if the company violates the terms of the contract, the farmer cannot prove it.<br><br> b) It does not have any provision to penalize companies which do not register their contracts. For eg: Last year, Potato farmers from Gujarat witnessed a big issue where Pepsico attempted to penalize potato farmers for growing the same seed varieties. The farmer organizations finally had to knock on the doors of the court and agitate to get justice.<br><br>c) Bill does not prescribe or specify that contract price of the crop should be at least equivalent or above the MSP. It means the contractor/companies can pay whatever price they want to the farmer. India‚Äôs experience of the contract farming has been poor with farmers getting very low rates through contract farming as compared to selling it in government mandis on MSPs (Minimum Support Price).<br><br><br>2. The Essential Commodities Act (Amendment) Bill: It empowers the Central government to regulate food items in extraordinary circumstances or impose stock limits if there is a steep price rise. However, the points of contention are:<br><br>a) Till now only farmers, farmer cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisations didn‚Äôt have any limit or restriction for stocking, producing or selling their crop. As a result, they take conscious decision of selling their crops only when the market or the buyer is offering good price for the crop. So, under this bill the farmers are not getting any new freedom. On the contrary the government is now removing all the foodstuffs from this category allowing companies and traders to store as much quantity of food as they want which amounts to promoting hoarding.<br><br>b) Through this Amendment the government is giving up its power to prevent hoarding and controlling price inflation. According to the law, government can intervene only if there is 50% price rise over previous year‚Äôs price in case of non-perishable goods and 100% price rise over previous year‚Äôs perishable goods.<br><br><br>3. Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill: It allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers produce beyond the physical premises of Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committee (APMC) markets. State will be now prohibited from levying any market fees or cess outside APMC areas.<br><br>a) The government says that now the farmers will have freedom to sell to anyone. Under the bill, the agri-business companies, corporate and traders will be allowed to open their own markets to purchase from farmers. However, the biggest fear coming from this is that it will destroy the level playing field between the APMC markets and other traders. Under the bill, the trade outside the APMC Mandis is virtually unregulated.<br><br>b) Farmers were demanding that in case the government is allowing, new set of farm markets to come up; the state and local government should be given power to oversee their functioning and also regulate them. However, the demand has been ignored.<br><br><br>c) Presently if the farmers feel the traders/corporate/agents working inside the APMC Mandis are involved in any unfair practices, they could complaint to the APMC Officers located in the yard itself. However, with the new Bill, in case of any disputes, farmers would be required to go to a sub-divisional magistrate court ‚Äì which is beyond the capacity of small farmers to pursue given their financial constraints.",2021-01-26T18:00:56Z,2021-01-26T18:00:56Z

There are union who are supporting these laws, they are also equally important...these leaders or farmers does not talk about flaws in the law only repeal..such mob mentality does not work in democracy.",2021-01-27T12:30:00Z,2021-01-27T12:30:00Z
,,,,,HPS vlog,@Paromita paul I totally agreed with you  even I dont support violent protest but m saying that government should not wait for such a long time to get to the point . The question why 2 state r prominent in protest bcz msp (in agriculture mandi system )is very much prevalent in these 2 state even I condemned the violent form of protest but i can&#39;t criticize the whole farming community achae log bhi hae burra log bhi hae .i think govt fails in communication with farming community and farming community it&#39;s self failed in understanding the bill .As an ADM I think   a policy to be called failed or successfully has strong linked in its implementation,2021-01-27T12:52:31Z,2021-01-27T12:52:31Z
,,,,,HPS vlog,@Paromita paul no hate u covered it very clearly but in administration aristocrats influence alot .I already knew it gonna take violent form even govt also knew even analysts also knew it . Mahatma Gandhi satyagraha started in non violent form and end in violent form in chauri chaura incident so we can&#39;t condemned Gandhi ji for that . At the end quit india movement do or die situation. As m thinking say the farmer protest r going to more violent in upcoming days if the govt and farmer not able to find middle path,2021-01-27T13:01:29Z,2021-01-27T13:01:29Z

Govt is taking all measures to back up the laws for eg from August 2020 till date almost 100 trains are allotted to carry farm goods from one part of the country to another,fair are cheap and wastage is less because of fast transport and farmers can sell there products  any where in the country were they get better price, entire India is a market for farmers,as a result farmers are trying to cultivate new products which does not have,a local market and earning much from it....like wise there are many examples.",2021-01-27T14:30:32Z,2021-01-27T14:31:22Z
