Ishpreet Kaur,"What happened that day is an expression of dissent by the farmers who have been peacefully protesting for 2 months and losing their loved ones amid cold and covid. Almost 150+ farmers died in the protest. The government passed the laws amid covid and declared postponing it just days prior to Republic Day for their reputation. They care less for the farmers and more about their image. Police clearly fired unprovoked tear gases to the peaceful protestors and the whole mess began. Thats a ground report ! Protestors were seen distributing water bottles to police and protecting female police from the chaos. Yes they hoisted their Sikh faith flag but what’s wrong with that? The National flag was way up higher and untouched and the Sikh faith flag is a reminder of the dissent of farmers who have heard zero response from their democratic prime minister about the farm law protests since day 1 as if pretending the country is well and stablilised. Guess what? The government stopped/slowed Internet services in the capital to prevent the authenticity of the day get out! <br><br><br>I would request everyone to check @sikhexpo page on Instagram. They have the ground reports and tell the whole truth. The media twisted the narrative as always. Trust me, as always.",2021-01-27T14:23:42Z,0,0,,,,

Miss me with that stubble burning BS.<br><br>I think the length depends on the exact point you consider the start. Google first said 5 months, I apologize if that is not the length of the protest in Delhi. It is still crazy to me that the government is still fighting back against these protests. Why would a benevolent democratic government want to keep in place farming laws that the farmers don&#39;t want? You guys need to take a step back look at all of this totalitarian rhetoric and partisanship that&#39;s being spewed in support of these bills. Even Trump supporters here in America aren&#39;t openly advocating for the government to &quot;better inform the public&quot; and for intelligence agencies to do &quot;a better job preventing misinformation&quot;.",2021-01-26T20:17:48Z,2021-01-26T20:17:48Z
,,,,,Dipayan Ghosh,"​@Daniel Schmidt-Lange the protest is based on misinformation. you have to understand the bill is directed towards distribution logistics which is already messed up. Look at India like EU, each state has its own language, culture and mostly a specific god/festival (subset of all the gods if they are hindu). The govt in the 70s (might be wrong about the timeline plz fact chk) initiated MSPS (Min Support price) to encourage the cultivation of certain crops. today the country has got substantial food security and the MSP way had led to the reduction of cultivation of certain other crops which didnt have MSP. <br>the farming system itself is a little complicated since there are farmers who own the lands and then lease them to laborers for farming (this is mostly the case but not always) and when one refers to farmer suicide it is these labors who commit suicide due to debt. the new law is a revision of the existing scenario. Mostly anyone who is an expert on farming logistics will tell you it&#39;s a good law. if there is a systemic problem that arises then that can be relooked at. <br><br>when this news is reported they make it sound like all farmers are protesting, but that is not the case. the ones who are protesting are the ones who have made a substantial investment in Paddy cultivation imagining they will get a minimum support price for that. But now the needs of the country doesn&#39;t reflect the need for paddy cultivation in such large quantities. These farmers (from 2-3 states out of a total of 29 states and 7 unions) in short among other things want this minimum support price to remain. it&#39;s very illogical. they don&#39;t want to change with the changing needs. <br><br>and unlike the United States, India doesn&#39;t have access to free public education, and the mass is often manipulated for political gains, so what they are protesting for might not reflect what is in best interest. if i draw a parallel, this is like the anti-vaxer protest or the ones that didn&#39;t want to wear masks more recently.",2021-01-26T22:40:34Z,2021-01-26T22:40:34Z
,,,,,Daniel Schmidt-Lange,"@Dipayan Ghosh I did watch a video that talked about the whole market and the effects of these laws, and I fail to quite understand how deregulating the farming industry is good for farmers? The current system was definitely weird, but was deregulation the solution? <br>Really I&#39;m just here b/c I&#39;m curious and saw a sht load of totalitarian rhetoric in the comments, not to tell India how to run their country.

,,,,,Samrudhi Chaware,"1. The Farmers (Empowerment &amp; Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill: It draws a framework for contract farming agreement between farmers and buyer before sowing of a crop and for dispute settlement prescribes three level mechanisms – the conciliation board, sub-divisional magistrate and appellate authority. However, the points of contention are:<br><br><br> a) Under this law it’s not mandatory for a company to make a written contract with the farmer for any contract farming. So, even if the company violates the terms of the contract, the farmer cannot prove it.<br><br> b) It does not have any provision to penalize companies which do not register their contracts. For eg: Last year, Potato farmers from Gujarat witnessed a big issue where Pepsico attempted to penalize potato farmers for growing the same seed varieties. The farmer organizations finally had to knock on the doors of the court and agitate to get justice.<br><br>c) Bill does not prescribe or specify that contract price of the crop should be at least equivalent or above the MSP. It means the contractor/companies can pay whatever price they want to the farmer. India’s experience of the contract farming has been poor with farmers getting very low rates through contract farming as compared to selling it in government mandis on MSPs (Minimum Support Price).<br><br><br>2. The Essential Commodities Act (Amendment) Bill: It empowers the Central government to regulate food items in extraordinary circumstances or impose stock limits if there is a steep price rise. However, the points of contention are:<br><br>a) Till now only farmers, farmer cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisations didn’t have any limit or restriction for stocking, producing or selling their crop. As a result, they take conscious decision of selling their crops only when the market or the buyer is offering good price for the crop. So, under this bill the farmers are not getting any new freedom. On the contrary the government is now removing all the foodstuffs from this category allowing companies and traders to store as much quantity of food as they want which amounts to promoting hoarding.<br><br>b) Through this Amendment the government is giving up its power to prevent hoarding and controlling price inflation. According to the law, government can intervene only if there is 50% price rise over previous year’s price in case of non-perishable goods and 100% price rise over previous year’s perishable goods.<br><br><br>3. Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill: It allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers produce beyond the physical premises of Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committee (APMC) markets. State will be now prohibited from levying any market fees or cess outside APMC areas.<br><br>a) The government says that now the farmers will have freedom to sell to anyone. Under the bill, the agri-business companies, corporate and traders will be allowed to open their own markets to purchase from farmers. However, the biggest fear coming from this is that it will destroy the level playing field between the APMC markets and other traders. Under the bill, the trade outside the APMC Mandis is virtually unregulated.<br><br>b) Farmers were demanding that in case the government is allowing, new set of farm markets to come up; the state and local government should be given power to oversee their functioning and also regulate them. However, the demand has been ignored.<br><br><br>c) Presently if the farmers feel the traders/corporate/agents working inside the APMC Mandis are involved in any unfair practices, they could complaint to the APMC Officers located in the yard itself. However, with the new Bill, in case of any disputes, farmers would be required to go to a sub-divisional magistrate court – which is beyond the capacity of small farmers to pursue given their financial constraints.",2021-01-26T18:00:56Z,2021-01-26T18:00:56Z

Even if you have some theories that its all created by foreign agents out to destroy your country, the government should never force people to think a certain way. Really its much more likely that farmers unions read these laws, saw that the regulation in the farming industry was about to be stripped away, and got pissed.<br><br><br>As for the whole flag stuff, I&#39;m sure its symbolic or something, but that doesn&#39;t seem like the most important part of this all, and its highly unlikely that any government cares about a flag being raised at a fort thingy.

,,,,,Sidh,@Minato Namikaze  you are thinking that I am supporting the terrorist group which I dont. There are more than 50 leaders of farmers currently protesting and people who gets brainwashed easily are thinking that the Khalistan group is leading the protest which they don’t. And the people who are there are not stupid that they will ruin there own peaceful protest. <br>Now suddenly there is a bomb blast near Israel embassy and there had been a lathi charge inside the protest . <br>Now here some facts about the riots which you prolly don’t know  <br>The people who went to Red Fort were not a part of that protest.<br>There are more than 200 people missing from the protest and it’s like police can’t even trace them ....or maybe won’t trace them but I will leave that to you rational mind to process it logically. <br>Every community is dealt differently but do you really think government should be given the right to hit or kill or politically ruin or prevent the protests from happening.? <br>You might not Be following it from the beginning but I am following it from quite a while now and one thing I know is that people who don’t really know about agriculture are trying to judge the current situation. <br>I don’t need to change my mindset because I am thinking how it can politically damage the India’s reputation and how can UN enter in India or interfere in internal matters of India because of numerous riots happened in previous years . Whom is to blame.? Hindus sikhs Muslims Christians.??? Common people .? ?? Or the current ruling government.????

Govt is taking all measures to back up the laws for eg from August 2020 till date almost 100 trains are allotted to carry farm goods from one part of the country to another,fair are cheap and wastage is less because of fast transport and farmers can sell there products  any where in the country were they get better price, entire India is a market for farmers,as a result farmers are trying to cultivate new products which does not have,a local market and earning much from it....like wise there are many examples.",2021-01-27T14:30:32Z,2021-01-27T14:31:22Z

,,,,,james gogoi,@HR 24 JAGGI maybe you are too full of hatred for the government so that you can&#39;t even see the difference between a political party and government. I believe in the government it&#39;s not permanent for any particular party. And to be precise m an atheist so technically I can&#39;t be anyone&#39;s bhakt. And regarding the other thing when you say something with confidence have the balls to defend it. Ciao.,2021-01-26T13:38:40Z,2021-01-26T13:38:40Z
