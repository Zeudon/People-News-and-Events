kiwiwala,"Khalistanis from Canada, UK, the Pakistani ISI, CPI and the Congress are all involved in stoking this fire....using gullible farmers for the agenda. . These guys are hell bent on causing chaos. The government must now show its mailed fist. The Police , CBI and NSI should document and investigate each and every rioter who has broken the laws of the country. There is no back down. This is treachery of the highest order. Rest of India must stand solidly behind the country/government in handling these anarchists.<br>I like farmers. I am a son of one. However, their behaviour during the Republic Day (a sacred day), with border incidents with China and the prevention of Covid spread, the good name of Punjab has besmirched. The government&#39;s offer of suspending the law for 18 months and for talks,  is very generous. My plea to the farmers is not to be used by other vested interests. If this stand off continues, there is going to be split among the farmers.....which is not good for anyone.  Go back and engage in talks. Jai hind.",2021-01-28T00:12:07Z,0,0,,,,

ModiTheGandu,Modi and BJP are without a doubt the worst thing to ever happen to India. The economy has tanked. Discrimination against minorities is through the roof. One protest after another. The government&#39;s response is to use their media outlets to blame Pakistan. Why is your economy garbage? Pakistan. Why did China invade and take your land? Pakistan. Why was your pilot get captured in Pakistan? Pakistan🤦,2021-01-27T03:59:29Z,1,0,,,,

Akshay R,This whole situation is deliberately created by modi. Bjp wanted to show this side of the protests to the world and they will careful planning created a choas with help of Delhi police and CRPF which made the farmers to change their designated March route. CRPF and Delhi police opened fired in laal kila and more than 100 farmers were injured and several died because of BJP govt plans. BJP very well know how to take political advantage of such situation as they have massive experience after Godra riots.,2021-01-26T17:10:32Z,0,0,,,,

A packeter cauliflower with the government seal on it)....and...u can&#39;t control inflation by curbing down prices from the producer ...if so ..the market price has to go down similarly....which isn&#39;t what we see..under the name of inflation...prices are kept at a standard rate. .so product is being bought from farmers at low cost...and sold at higher one ..whose gaining?...if u say the Government is....simple question again...for years.  The Government has been feeding off hiked petrol prices. ..not just rupee one or two...compared to neighbouring countries ..by twenty or thirty rupees ..that&#39;s per litre. .so wher does akk this money go..for one rupee rise in petrol.

,,,,,Sachin Rawat,"@H Z if you want to research on inflation more, you would find that certain rate of inflation i.e. 4 to5 % is good for economy, you should not make it higher as it will effect people badly, but you cannot it negative as it will efdect the growth, for example if you are manufacturer of a good that cannot be consumed in higher amount like toothpaste or vegetables etc where people cannot use it more than they require, then as a manufacturer you would your company to grow every year and given that you cannot increase demand of such product, you can only grow with inflation, but that rate must be higher than the interest rate that banks offer you, else no one would want to become a manufacturer and would simple deposite thier money in banks and live with the interest that banks provide you.<br>About the vast diffrence between the prices that farmers gets and consumer pay, most of difference is earned by the middleman as govt doesnot buy everything from farmers, only 6% of the yields that farmer produces is procured by the govt, rest is procured by middlemen or food processing companies. Govt has to increase the share of these companies as they pay more to farmers and hence these laws.<br>About petrol, govt want to increase their revenue here, we take billions of dollars as loan every year and 80% of it is just paid back as interest of previous loans, this govt is spending so much in infrastructure that it needs it, you can view all informatiin about ongoing infra projects, the olny reason i support this govt is infra and nothing else, they are bad at creating govt jobs and they cant deny at, economy is hit by demonetization and gst yes sure but every country adopting gst has been hit hard for atleast 5 years but then it striked back and we can see it here too",2021-01-26T08:18:55Z,2021-01-26T08:26:51Z
,,,,,Sachin Rawat,"@pawan deep singh &quot;involving processing, packaging,<br>storage, transport and distribution, where at each stage value is added to the product.&quot;<br>Please read it carefully, there is &quot;and&quot;  not &quot;or&quot;. It means that everything is included here, and company cannot just process and sell it to other company then it wont fall under these exempted organisation.<br>About Ashirwad ata they also procure wheat and they process it by grinding and then pack it and then sell it to end consumers or dealers. So its not being directly bought and sold commodity. Moreover, wheat falls under the produce where govt offers MSP",2021-01-26T08:26:20Z,2021-01-26T08:26:20Z
,,,,,H Z,@Sachin Rawat ok Some of what u say makes sense...I am not illiterate I am an orthopedic surgeon...and I studied economics....till my 10th😂...and my Dad did ECON....these laws....have a theoretical graph....considering produce  season and fertility as constants....which farmers argue isn&#39;t....and trust me....if I were to produce sumthng...I wud prefer to price it myslf ..or based on an MSP..than a corporate rating....and Fuel price hike cannot be justified on any accounts.... Pakisthan is a country which doesn&#39;t have a GDP or an Export Import ratio as much as India...why are they selling it for 58 rupees per liter?....Why is nG promoted on India at Half the rate of LNG?( Adani being one of rhe share holders of CNG),2021-01-26T08:28:29Z,2021-01-26T08:28:29Z
