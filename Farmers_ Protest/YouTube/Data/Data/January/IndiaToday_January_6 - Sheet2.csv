ModiTheGandu,Modi and BJP are without a doubt the worst thing to ever happen to India. The economy has tanked. Discrimination against minorities is through the roof. One protest after another. The government&#39;s response is to use their media outlets to blame Pakistan. Why is your economy garbage? Pakistan. Why did China invade and take your land? Pakistan. Why was your pilot get captured in Pakistan? Pakistan🤦,2021-01-27T03:58:50Z,1,0,,,,
