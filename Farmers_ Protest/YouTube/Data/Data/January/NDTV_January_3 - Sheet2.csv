,,,,,Jatin Final58,"@Namreeta Brar every citizen in our country supports farmers. The 3 farm bills are not completely at fault, they must be amended. If the 3 farm bills are repealed farmers will keep growing wheat and paddy under incentive of msp and subsidy without proper crop rotation, which will lead to desertification and low water table within 10 years. Then what will 90℅ agrarian Punjab do, huh?",2021-01-26T07:09:17Z,2021-01-26T07:10:05Z
