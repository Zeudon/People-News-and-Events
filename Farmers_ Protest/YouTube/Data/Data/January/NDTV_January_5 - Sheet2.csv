Razzi Warraich,"Modi ji, apka bohat dhanayawaad ki apne hame yeh samjjaya ki 26 January ko Laal Kille ki pratishtha ke apmaan hua, hamara jhande ka apmaan hua. Video dekh kar yeh to pata chal gaya ki hamare jhnade ka apmaan nahi hua hai, jhnada sabb se uppar shan se lehra raha hai. Dhanyawaad ho media ka jinhone hamen yeh santushti karva di ki jhanda nahi uttara gaya. Nishan Sahib jis ne Hindu dharam ko bachaya, hamari izzat ko bachaya, Laal Killa 18 baar fateh kiya, woh hamare tirange ki bilkul neeche laga aur ik pole pur laga. <br><br>Laikin hum yeh kabhi bhi bardasht nahi karenge ki hamare us Laal Kille ka apmaan ho jo Mughalon ne itni mehnat se banaya tha. Jis Laal Kille mein unhone Shasak ban karr hum logon par 800 saal raaj kiya aur hamein gulaam banaya. Jis Laal kille me baith kar Mughlon ne Hinduon ki mass extinction ka farmaan jari kiya, jis laal kille mein Hinduon ke dharam ka mass conversion ka aadesh jari hua, hum us Laal Kille ki partishtha ko kharaab kisi keemat pur nahi hone de sakte. Yeh hamari aan baan ka sawal hai. To kya hua ki Mughalon ko Sikhon ne khadedh diya pur unki dhrohar ka samaan karna hamara param kartavaya hai. <br><br>Isi Laal kille ko Sikhon ne 18 baar jeeta aur is par apna Nishan Sahib fehra kar unhone Zalim Mughalon ko unki aukaad dikha di jinhon ne Hinduon pe 800 saal itne zulam kiye. Yeh wahi Khlasa Sikh hain jo Guru Gobind Singh ji ne Mughalon ke zulmon ka khatama karne ke liye taiyaar kiye. Mughlon ke raaj ko khatam karne wale bhi Sikh hi the jo unhe ‘Dariyai Khaibar’ har dhakel ker aa gaye the aur uske baad koi bhi lootera us raste se Bharat main dakhil nahi hua. Bharat desh ke liye shahadaten saab se zada shahadeten inhi Sikhon ne hi di hain. Jhande ki ehmeeyat to un logon ko bohhat ache se pata hi hogi ken ke ghar mein isi jhande mein lipatkar border se lashen atti hain. <br><br>Laal kille ka apmaan toh us apmaan se bhi zada hua hai jab Mughal hamari betiyon ko utha kar le jate the aur Sikh apni jaan ki bazzi laga kar unhe bacha kar latte the. Isi Laal Kille me Guru Teg Bahadur ji ka sar dhad se alag karne ka hukam jaari hua, jinho ne Hindu dharm bachane ke liye apni shahadat dee thi. Yeh woh Laal Killa jo hum pur hoye Zulmon ka parteek hai aur iski kone kone mein Hinduon aur Sikhon ka khoon laga hua hai. Woh 800 saal ki gulami aur dehshat aaj bhi hamen hum pur huye zulmon ko yaad dilati hai. <br><br>Kya hum isi Laal Kille ke apmaan ki baat kar rahe hain?",2021-02-06T22:13:33Z,0,0,,,,

Carpe Diem,"Guys please know that the Indian government did this exact same thing in 1984. Sikhs were fighting the corrupt government then too, they were fighting for INDIA. They were NOT asking for Khalistan. But the government maligned their movement like they tried to do with this one, calling them terrorists and Khalistanis and turned Hindus against Sikhs. And since there was no social media at that time, the public was successfully fooled by the government (Congress at the time). BJP is the same as Congress. Remember that in the next elections people. Vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change. If you really want to see a true democratic India with a government that is FOR its people, and not looting its people in broad daylight. Please realize this before it’s too late, before India is bought by goons.",2021-01-31T03:31:17Z,1,0,,,,

,,,,,nikit sharma,@Harish Hari     Hospitality of free food ?  Well their are thousands of  Hindu Temples who feed for food. The temple in Karnataka feeds free food everyday more than all the Gurudrawa combined. The soldier and commander of Sikh gurus were Hindus. But Hindus never do anything for publicity. They don’t tell people around of their greatness. Yesterday in Rome (Italy) Indian embassy was destroyed by Sikhs. All my Sikh friends who have not been the part of this movement are supporting this riots and sympathies with separatists terrorists like Bhindranwale. Sikhs fuelled Shaheen Bagh anti CAA by offering free food their so that their anti national activities can run. All the Sikhs in Canada and UK join hands with Pakistanis and shout anti Indian slogans on Streets of foreign countries.

Or kisaan company se advance me bhi paise le sakte hai jis se unhen loan nahi lena padega or nahi bank ke chakkar lagane padenge or na koi intrust lagega.<br>Or 2nd part of bill the assential commodities act  ke according ab govt ne assential commodities like cereal, pulses, oilseeds, onion potatoes etc ko store karne ki permission de di hai jo purane bill ke acc illegal tha.<br>Or govt inhe store karne ke liye cold stores banvayegi or incentive bhi degi.<br>And third part of bill farmer&#39;s produce trade and commerce promotion and facilitation bill.<br>Is bill ke according kisan apna maal kahi bhi bech sakta hai ab use mandi me bechane ki zooroorat nahi hai. Kyunki mandi me bicholiye apas me milkar minimum price par boli lagate the jiski vajah se kisan ko utne hi daam par anaj bechana padta tha or upar se tax alag dena padta tha kisan ko mandi mein.<br>Or ab  vo country ke kisi bhi parti me anaj  bech sakta hai jaha use jyada daam mil raha ho.<br>Or rahi baat msp ki to govt msp ki gurqntee dene ko taiyar hai jo kisan leader hai unhen govt ne msp ki gurantee dene ka vada kiya hai.",2021-02-02T08:58:46Z,2021-02-02T09:15:22Z
,,,,,Dixit Angiras,@Parshvinder Singh are bhai haryana or punjab me govt msp de rahi thi us vajah se kisaano ko ghata nahi ho raha tha.<br>But apmc to vaha bhi minimum rate par maal kharidati thi jis se jo msp or wholesale ke beech ka gap gov ko apne fund se dena padta tha or govt ka loss ho raha tha. or bicholiyon ka fayda ho raha tha.<br>For example wheet par msp 25 rs per kg  hai or kisaan mandi me jata hai to vaha wheat ka wholesale price 5 rs per kg hai to kisan ko to mandi me hi 5 rs per kg maal bechna padega but unko govt ki taraf se 25 rs per kg hi milega to jo msp or wholesale ke beech ka gap hai vo govt hi bharti thi. Matlab apmc se loss punjab or haryana me bhi ho raha tha par vo loss govt ko ho raha tha kyonki govt kisano ko msp de rahi thi. Par ab naye bill ke acc kisan direct apna maal bech sakta hai jis se use 5-6 guna jyada daam milega or kisaan ka hi fayda hoga. Kyunki apmc mandi me kisanon ko bhi tax dena padta tha.<br>Or govt ko bhi loss nahi hoga bas kahi loss ho raha hai to vo bicholiyon ka ho raha hai. Or vo hi kisano ko bhadka rahe hai.

Angela Paul,There is no point in making statements based on what happened today. It was the resultant of continued torture and denial of rights the govt imposed on farmers who were protesting for their genuine cause.  Many of today&#39;s incidents were created by other malwares. You should be proud that the farmers still managed to conduct their protest and the damages ended by this. I would give full credit to them for conducting it this neat ! Actually I admire them. No other political group could have done this with this much precision. It was  a hard blow on BJP dictatorship 💪💪<br><br>No public was reported hurt.  It&#39;s sad a 24 year old protestor was shot in the head. All criticising farmers should  go and find out who is that anti national criminal who shot him 😏😏 Again you should appreciate the effort and just try to imagine  the kind of great risks the farmers took. You should be brave and should posses a quality to belive in a cause. Spineless people lwill never understand that . So don&#39;t bother 😏,2021-01-26T14:53:46Z,0,0,,,,

,,,,,Vibhanshu Dobhal,That&#39;s true. What the farmers are alleging is that Government will shut down the Mandis. The logic they give is that the private companies will offer more price for the first few years which will force the government to close the Mandis. Personally I feel this logic makes no sense for the following two reasons: 1) to think the private companies can buy all the produce at the price higher than MSP is honestly crazy. Government buys only a fraction of total produce and it costs well over a billion dollars. So I don&#39;t know if that is possible.<br>2) MSP/Mandis been a part of the welfare state can run in losses( kinda sad but true) like every public programme. Also the APMC aren&#39;t even under the jurisdiction of the central government so that rules out the forced closure.,2021-01-26T15:35:13Z,2021-01-26T15:35:13Z
