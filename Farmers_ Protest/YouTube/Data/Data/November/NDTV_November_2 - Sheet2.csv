In Punjab  and Haryana there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation, big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany  . These big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to logistics and resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india.

,,,,,Tina K,"@Manish K S Wow, you make me laugh. None of the farmers have twisted anyones arm or leg. Get your facts right, itтАЩs modi thats strangling these farmers and their families. These farmers do no have ego and have gone to Delhi(your hostage city) because they are invited by Egoistic Modi. Modi has not even budged after all this. It pretty much sums up who has ego and who does not. And yes I look forward to yourself joining the parliament.",2020-11-29T19:59:57Z,2020-11-29T19:59:57Z
