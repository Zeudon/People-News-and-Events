Philip,"This is inhumane, very good protest, where are the evil BJP, leader&#39;s and MInister&#39;s, why so much of tension at the border&#39;s, why not they allow them to protest peacefully, but instead allowing riots to happen, who&#39;s responsible for this???, Good farmer&#39;s have taken a right decision, fight for all your right&#39;s till the government listen to your pleas, why only social distancing when farmer&#39;s are protesting peacefully? why not social distancing when voting is going on in the State???",2020-11-26T11:25:25Z,1,0,,,,
