Monal Patel,Its funny when congress oppose this bill like any other thing but the same bill was in their election manifesto of 2019 election.<br>the Only  work of opposition is to delay the reforms and not allow to do anything productive.,2020-09-21T06:34:37Z,1,12,,,,
,,,,,Swapnil N,It is same like GST and Rafael deal. UPA concepts were different. Ask feku how he used to talk about MNREGA. How he used to talk about Aadhar.,2020-09-21T08:37:11Z,2020-09-21T08:37:11Z
,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Swapnil N again, rather than engaging in good conversation you choose words like feku which completely delegitimizes any meaning to any debate. <br>Congress remains the party with good ideas but BJP is the party of IMPLEMENTING ideas.",2020-09-21T09:27:51Z,2020-09-21T09:27:51Z
,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Swapnil N In its 2019 poll manifesto, the Congress had gone a step further, saying it would “repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act and make a trade in agricultural produce—including exports and inter-state trade—free from all restrictions.”",2020-09-21T09:29:15Z,2020-09-21T09:29:15Z
,,,,,Swapnil N,"@Monal Patel How on earth the word feku delegitimized the conversation? Isn&#39;t it truth that he sells jumla? How on earth demonetization GST were implemented in so called &quot;good&quot;way? On the other hand, BJP remains name changing party only. They renamed almost all schemes of UPA. And on top of it, they first opposed them. For example, can u tell me what feku used to say about MNREGA? What he used to say about &quot;aadhaar&quot;?",2020-09-21T09:31:35Z,2020-09-21T09:31:35Z
,,,,,Swapnil N,"@Monal Patel ufff again same. There is difference between Rafael deal of UPA and rafael deal of NDA. There is difference between how aadhaar was used under UPA and under NDA. Same thing here. Farmer just want one sentence to be added &quot;If anyone purchase below MSP then jail&quot;. Now don&#39;t ask me if UPA government would had done it or not, we will never know now.",2020-09-21T09:41:35Z,2020-09-21T09:41:35Z
,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Swapnil N Dude dont even talk about rafale deal. It&#39;s been a bust that&#39;s why it never came into fruitation. In fact, in 2013,  ak antony straight up said in parliament that they have no money to fund the MMRCA deal. the ToT negotiations were happening but nothing ever finalized because expecting ToT from such aircraft doesn&#39;t come cheap. Also their deal didn&#39;t include any ammunition or BVR missiles which were included in NDA&#39;s complete deal. Now our airforce uses MICA(which is also tested on SU-30KMI jets), Meteor and Hammer missile. So don&#39;t even talk about them vs their because there was no deal in congress govt if it ever was something would have moved between the period of MMCRCA competition which happened in 2011 and 2014 .",2020-09-21T10:12:17Z,2020-09-21T10:12:17Z
,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Swapnil N Trust me, the moment i started using words like pappu, Italian. It would derail any logical debate and things only will turn on exchanging insults and abuses. Remember, namecalling and mocking someone in debate is always stupid. Debate on facts and that&#39;s how it goes. Noone said Modi govt is perfect. They have flaws, their work has flaws. Everyone does. GST has been in process of evolution since the day it passed. Several amendments were done by the feedbacks of GST counsil. If you calm down your biased nerve then you can find many good things too, ofcourse bad ones are also there.",2020-09-21T10:16:54Z,2020-09-21T10:16:54Z
,,,,,Swapnil N,"@Monal Patel lol, the deal was few rafael ready to use condition and rest in time along with technology transfer at 1/3 rd cost. Now new deal, bring ambani in between who has 15 days defence experience company (god knows where it is) and give him cut (god knows why) and purchase jets at 3 times a price without technology transfer. As usual, government won&#39;t show any documents. Another thing is this china business. Feku is so afraid to even speak china name even if tension along LAC. After 18 visits with xing pin, this is the result. I remember he used to say words love letter and show red eyes. Forget eyes, he is now not even in position to write letters.",2020-09-21T12:55:42Z,2020-09-21T12:55:42Z

,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Edwin Rodrigues Could you explain how congress bill was different from BJP&#39;s bill ? As far as I can see, it only provides alternative to farmers and freedom to sell anywhere where they get the better price. The mandi system with MSP is unaltered and will be available as usual for farmer.",2020-09-24T04:53:21Z,2020-09-24T04:53:21Z
,,,,,Monal Patel,"@Swapnil N Where do you get this information. There was no deal. AK Antony straight up said in parliament that they don&#39;t have any funds to buy rafale because the deal was never finalised. Again, please don&#39;t talk like rahul gandhi. Do you know the word inflation, the so called deal which they proposed was in 2011 and the revised deal was finalised about 6-7 years later. <br>Also talking about the price, UPA deal didn&#39;t include any ammunations for Rafale(MICA missile, Hammer, Beyond visual range missile METEOR), spare parts, aircraft maintenance clause from France for years.<br>Modi is the toughest on CHina, that&#39;s why the standoff. If it was for congress, they would have surrendered like they did in 62 and continuously many parts since 2004. Have you ever bothered to check why china is pissed, Modi govt has been rapidly developing border infrastructure so easy troop movement,  rapid logistics can be established at the border. BRO has been working on a war mode, constructed impossible roads, tunnels, bridges. Road building was the cause china was agitated which caused galwan valley clash. They never imagined that India can build at these heights. While china has built world class infrastructure on their side of the border, they have been repeatedly opposing us to construct it because they know when time comes, we can choke their CHina-pakistan economic corridor and Indian navy can block them in strait of Malacca if war comes in a picture.<br>We all are Indian, at least let get the facts straight.",2020-09-24T05:05:36Z,2020-09-24T05:05:36Z
,,,,,Swapnil N,"@Monal Patel haha, i heard that ak antony BS before, what it has to do with prices? Looks like you have more information on rafael than supreme court. Stop talking like feku. We have heard his man ki bakwas and stoped watching it. Talking about inflation is big joke, 3 times price really and that too through 15 days ambani company which only bhakts can point out its location. On top of it no technology transfer. Make in india went to gutter long back i guess. Feku has not even taken china word from his mouth, after meeting 18 times with great hospitality this is the outcome of 18 hours hard work i guess. War mode, haha, never even heard of china name from his mouth even in covid and now after killing soldiers. FYI, feku is silent because he has taken too much loan from china and now he will be in trouble if he speaks out against them. Don&#39;t you even start on we are indians, i have seen bhakts like you who used to start talking anti national, terrorist, pakistani words so often. We know we are indians.",2020-09-24T13:21:03Z,2020-09-24T13:21:03Z

,,,,,Monal Patel,How Large MNC can control anything when existing Mandi system will be available. It will only give more options and freedom to farmers to sell their goods to anyone without a middleman.,2020-09-21T06:33:09Z,2020-09-21T06:33:09Z

,,,,,Monal Patel,@Cry Vell That&#39;s called being presumptuous. PM specifically said that mandi system will be available as always. They are providing freedom for farmers to sell anywhere. Do you know it require Dsitrict megistrate&#39;s  permission to sell matar outside your state. Mills cant purchase the crop directly from farmer. This mandi system monopoly has cost farmer&#39;s no profit. Just some middleman go profited from farmer&#39;s hard work. This bill is just giving them alternatives to sell THEIR goods without restrictions and with complete freedom. They can choose mandi with the MSP available there or they can get a struck a deal directly with mills or any other trader for that matter.,2020-09-21T08:11:33Z,2020-09-21T08:11:33Z
,,,,,Cry Vell,"@Monal Patel lets wait and see bro. Based on Modis past promises i cant bee too positive. He never stood by his promises.

Because NDTV asks government questions, they have almost stop sending spokeperson. Hence, on her capacity, they ask people to come. All know she is from BJP, but since she herself can&#39;t defend as BJP party spokeperson, she has come as political analyst.

Danish,They all want parliament to follow laws and norms for passage farm bill. But then they said nothing when they never took permissions from Kashmiris or their legislatures to abolish article 370 - that too happened in a similar “might is right” way. So how can you expect the government to behave in a saint like manner here? This is their habit now. And the only thing that can treta them a lesson is electoral defeat.,2020-09-20T22:28:36Z,3,0,,,,

,,,,,Swapnil N,"@Zorba Nope, you are wrong on many counts. For example, there is difference between 90 percent biased and 10 percent biased. I don&#39;t think indian media was monopolized under congress. For example, if it would had been so, then media would not had shown fake 2G scam and toppled the government.

You are talking about spying case, but forgot easily that BJP outfits literally mob lynched muslims. Cabinet minister literally brought flowers for that inspector singh killers. We have seen how fake news of feku was circulated and detained activists, and later nothing happened. Modia didn&#39;t show all these news but NDTV did. JNU, all videos are there how BJP goons entered and bash students, no arrest for them and only NDTV showed.
