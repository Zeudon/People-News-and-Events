Sumanpreet Kaur,"Modi is affecting so many lives. This needs to stop, we need to stand up for our country and stop this idiotic maniac. We have had enough, this piece of trash has done NOTHING good for our country, now it&#39;s our turn to use OUR voices and get the respect we deserve. And in India there are not that many COVID cases half of them were made up by Modi and alot of doctors scared people so they won&#39;t protest! Many people who has strokes, heart attacks or any other problem were told they have &quot;covid&quot; When they didn&#39;t. India was very taking alot of cautions but what the doctors did not bhai nirmal singh ji was wrong, they said he had &quot;covid&quot; But really he didn&#39;t he got a heart attack. <br>and we r done!

She even mocked the farmers calling them fake actors so its waste to mention her name. Farmers do way lot then what the fake life actor or actress potrait. BJP use SSR death to contest election but no justice for SSR so we all know where they are, no where just intoxicated in their ego and arrogance. I stand with farmers because the very farmers people are mocking cause they are protesting for their future, esp punjab and harayana produce rice which we will be giving to China as its short of food supply. So farmers are doing as much as soliders protecting us from hunger and starvation. Mandi system is the reason we have food reserve which will be send to china for the food crisis.

All government jobs lost, direct entry of private players into agriculture and our media is busy with kangana and Sushant.

,,,,,kiran sandhu,"@Sneh Patel I hope you have bill open next to you or read it. In chapter 2 point 6, its clearly mentioned that any trade outside the APMC won‚Äôt be entitled to tax, or any trade out of the mandi would be free of the APMC act. Presently, any trade in APMC or mandi is entitled to 8% taxation. So my nature no one is a fool and willing to pay a tax. This is a way to facilitate farmers to go for more private player, eventually no trade in APMC will result in mandi to dissolve over time. As the private players initially will give lucrative prices. However, overtime this will result in shrinking and weaking of APMC and eventually end of them. Then farmers would be left only to private buyers. These buyers normally work in group. How I know, as I have worked and had dealt both the ends. I know the union of the private buyers and how they control certain prices. People are debating mandi or APMC are bad. However, data shows the farmers are doing well with present APMC both in Punjab and Haryana. Mandi, have always been shown bad but in other states hardly in Punjab or Harayana, also there can be few bad apples that doesn‚Äôt mean the system is not working there. Also, you should understand the 8% tax goes to state govt. State govt need to carry out different activities which are not paid why centre and are state affair and this tax contributes towards it. <br>Also, people argue it gives the farmers the freedom to trade. I want to ask show me the data how many farmers do interstate trade. As most of the food items are perishable and often when farmers sell one crop its critical as exact same time they grow another crop to In india there is poor infrastructure and storage and if a farmer crosses three state do you know they have to grease hands of people on their way. There is no sure short buyers at the end so often resulting farmers in dire state and often exploited. That‚Äôs why you often hear how farmers dispose their tomato or crops because of poor price. <br>Chapter 3 and point 8,9 regarding the dispute resolution. Here, the govt is giving all the power to the SDM, he will be the prime person carrying out the final call in points of dispute and non payment. People who are arguing saying officials in mandi are exploiting farmers, how are they showed SDM won‚Äôt be corrupt. There was news from Rajasthan where SDM was found in corruption charge taking 10000 Rs. Some trade are worth 50 lakhs so it won‚Äôt be much of pain to private buyers to bribe SDM and pay him so he gives verdict in the favour of the private buyer then the farmer. <br>Chapter 5 , point 15 they have barred the entrance or interference of any civil court in any cases regarding any action regarding this act. <br>Lastly, there is no mention of MSP, it‚Äôs a minimum selling price, so it‚Äôs a safety net for the farmers. It assures the farmer that for a crop they will get this price so this gives an advantage to the farmer because they can choose if they want to grow something to sell to a private buyer. But if they didn‚Äôt had good experience or good price they can opt to grow and sell it at MSP.",2020-12-02T23:27:04Z,2020-12-02T23:27:04Z

,,,,,kiran sandhu,"@Shobha Shetty You can get the pdf of the bill online and refer to it, here are the points which are of concern in the bill. In chapter 2 point 6, its clearly mentioned that any trade outside the APMC won‚Äôt be entitled to tax, or any trade out of the mandi would be free of the APMC act. Presently, any trade in APMC or mandi is entitled to 8% taxation. So my nature no one is a fool and willing to pay a tax. This is a way to facilitate farmers to go for more private player, eventually no trade in APMC will result in mandi to dissolve over time. As the private players initially will give lucrative prices. However, overtime this will result in shrinking and weaking of APMC and eventually end of them. Then farmers would be left only to private buyers. These buyers normally work in group. How I know, as I have worked and had dealt both the ends. I know the union of the private buyers and how they control certain prices. People are debating mandi or APMC are bad. However, data shows the farmers are doing well with present APMC both in Punjab and Haryana. Mandi, have always been shown bad but in other states hardly in Punjab or Harayana, also there can be few bad apples that doesn‚Äôt mean the system is not working there. Also, you should understand the 8% tax goes to state govt. State govt need to carry out different activities which are not paid why centre and are state affair and this tax contributes towards it. <br>Also, people argue it gives the farmers the freedom to trade. I want to ask show me the data how many farmers do interstate trade. As most of the food items are perishable and often when farmers sell one crop its critical as exact same time they grow another crop to In india there is poor infrastructure and storage and if a farmer crosses three state do you know they have to grease hands of people on their way. There is no sure short buyers at the end so often resulting farmers in dire state and often exploited. That‚Äôs why you often hear how farmers dispose their tomato or crops because of poor price. <br>Chapter 3 and point 8,9 regarding the dispute resolution. Here, the govt is giving all the power to the SDM, he will be the prime person carrying out the final call in points of dispute and non payment. People who are arguing saying officials in mandi are exploiting farmers, how are they showed SDM won‚Äôt be corrupt. There was news from Rajasthan where SDM was found in corruption charge taking 10000 Rs. Some trade are worth 50 lakhs so it won‚Äôt be much of pain to private buyers to bribe SDM and pay him so he gives verdict in the favour of the private buyer then the farmer. <br>Chapter 5 , point 15 they have barred the entrance or interference of any civil court in any cases regarding any action regarding this act. <br>Lastly, there is no mention of MSP, it‚Äôs a minimum selling price, so it‚Äôs a safety net for the farmers. It assures the farmer that for a crop they will get this price so this gives an advantage to the farmer because they can choose if they want to grow something to sell to a private buyer. But if they didn‚Äôt had good experience or good price they can opt to grow and sell it at MSP.",2020-12-02T23:28:09Z,2020-12-02T23:28:09Z

Also like HM promised to meet and join them in a meeting two days back . At last minute he dropped out and was not there.
