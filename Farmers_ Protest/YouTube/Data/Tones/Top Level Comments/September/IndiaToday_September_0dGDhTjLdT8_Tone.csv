RINKU GHOSH,main thing is that farmers are not ready to hear at all.....so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fools....there is clearly written in bill no land of farmers will be taken....and if farmers do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at a better price....and its not that farmers are not getting MSP ...they are getting more msp as compared to 2014.....so i think we must support farm bills...,"{'document_tone': {'tones': [{'score': 0.734846, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.519491, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}]}}"
Shankar SM,"One or two states were given priority during the times of food shortage in India and these were Punjab and Haryana. The system of commissions this agents and tax collected by the state I&#39;d not correct since this need not be supported by the Central Government and if so then all states have to be given similar status. The fear that private traders would take advantage is too be volunteered by the farmers through collective bargaining and they can have these commission agents in their behalf. Also if farmers are happy with commission agents, these people can themselves become the sole traders.  All said and done while government is coming out of public sector participation slowly evenin defence, telephones, power, aviation etc., It is not reasonable to ask Central Government to be the left purchaser of food grains. Ofcourse Central and State governments would come to help farmers whenever there is a need since farming is the backbone of the country. While every other states&#39; farmers go directly to markets and were happy when levy on rice mills were lifted his can these farmers have a different treatment even after decades? Politicised farmers are taking to bandhs in these difficult times giving based name to all farmers in general.","{'document_tone': {'tones': [{'score': 0.559107, 'tone_id': 'joy', 'tone_name': 'Joy'}, {'score': 0.637301, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.633907, 'tone_id': 'fear', 'tone_name': 'Fear'}, {'score': 0.685872, 'tone_id': 'confident', 'tone_name': 'Confident'}]}, 'sentences_tone': [{'sentence_id': 0, 'text': 'One or two states were given priority during the times of food shortage in India and these were Punjab and Haryana.', 'tones': []}, {'sentence_id': 1, 'text': 'The system of commissions this agents and tax collected by the state I&#39;d not correct since this need not be supported by the Central Government and if so then all states have to be given similar status.', 'tones': []}, {'sentence_id': 2, 'text': 'The fear that private traders would take advantage is too be volunteered by the farmers through collective bargaining and they can have these commission agents in their behalf.', 'tones': [{'score': 0.82657, 'tone_id': 'fear', 'tone_name': 'Fear'}]}, {'sentence_id': 3, 'text': 'Also if farmers are happy with commission agents, these people can themselves become the sole traders.', 'tones': [{'score': 0.693498, 'tone_id': 'joy', 'tone_name': 'Joy'}, {'score': 0.664451, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}]}, {'sentence_id': 4, 'text': 'All said and done while government is coming out of public sector participation slowly evenin defence, telephones, power, aviation etc., It is not reasonable to ask Central Government to be the left purchaser of food grains.', 'tones': [{'score': 0.543925, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}]}, {'sentence_id': 5, 'text': 'Ofcourse Central and State governments would come to help farmers whenever there is a need since farming is the backbone of the country.', 'tones': [{'score': 0.586984, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}]}, {'sentence_id': 6, 'text': 'While every other states&#39; farmers go directly to markets and were happy when levy on rice mills were lifted his can these farmers have a different treatment even after decades?', 'tones': [{'score': 0.517677, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}]}, {'sentence_id': 7, 'text': 'Politicised farmers are taking to bandhs in these difficult times giving based name to all farmers in general.', 'tones': [{'score': 0.673074, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.809841, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}, {'score': 0.6821, 'tone_id': 'confident', 'tone_name': 'Confident'}]}]}"

Its only because of state government politics and misguidance which has lead to chaos. Not at all farmer&#39;s fault. Nor the central government&#39;s fault.

Pramod,"I heard a very interesting analogy today,<br>A 10 floor building did not have a lift, so people had problem climbing up and down. Specially the elderly and the kids, so the society started exploring options.<br>Finally they got some donkeys, who could carry people up and down. The donkey owners would charge people for carrying them up and down for a fee and would also pay 10% to the society from the revenue they earned. It was a very happy situation for all involved.<br>After sometime the society management changed, the new management decided to install a lift for carrying people up and down.<br>All hell broke loose and everyone started protesting, this is not fair, society will loose revenue, the donkey owners will be jobless and no food for them (human rights issue), the donkeys will be worthless (animals rights issue), all were angry.<br>Society management clarified, the lift is available to all but the gentlemen who wanted to use the donkeys could still do it. But no, the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure.<br>The final arrangement was arrived and so anyone who wanted to climb the building could still use the donkey. The donkey would carry a person, go in the lift and carry people up &amp; down.

Vivecan Stan,Punjab farmer will become more rich and prosperous if they carefully understand the bill like Western Countries&#39; farmer. Farmers should be little patient instead of assuming as if MODI is some representative of Ambani/Adani. Modi is 70 year old and he doesn&#39;t need money from Ambani and Adani. Stop blaming Modi. Modi is transforming India so that farmer&#39;s generations in future can continue to be proud farmers of India with richness and wealth. Modi is bringing India at par with Western economies. Farmers are misinformed. Modi is cleaning up mess of Congress and Corruption.
