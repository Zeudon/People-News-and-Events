Punjabi Class,"Delhi Parliament itself needs reforming and modernisation.  Passing of the 3 farmers bills is testimony of failures in following the rule books of Parliament. A handful of people decided the fate of millions without debates and  consultations. A bill that is passed under controversial circumstances should not become law.<br><br>On 20 September 2020, in Parliament the rule book was ignored by the chairman.<br><br>1. The rule book says that if a voice vote is challenged by any member, the chairman must ask for a division. Under no circumstances must a chairman ignore this demand. The chairman ignored this demand.  <br><br>2. Audio and broadcasting was censored in parliament when division was demanded by opposition so the public could not see it.<br><br>3. BJP did not have enough numbers to pass the bill so it rushed it in an undemocratic way.<br><br>4. Voice vote is only chosen where 70 percent of members support a bill. This bill did not meet that criteria so voice vote does not apply.  However, the chairman decided to go ahead with voice vote and for his ears, it was a yes. Voice vote is not recorded so it&#39;s open to controversy.<br><br>5. When members stood from their seats, the rule book says that Parliament should have been adjourned. The chairman did not adjourn the parliament. He rushed the bill through instead.<br><br>6. Opposition requested the bills to be put forward to a select committee. The chairman denied them that opportunity, again against the rule book.<br><br>7. Not enough time was given for the bill to run in Gujrat as a trial. Gujratis have not openly praised the bills.<br><br>8. BJP refused to have a debate on the bills. They rushed them through.<br><br>9. There are 4 ways of voting: voice vote, counting vote, voting recorder or votes by lobbying. The weakest voting method  is voice vote.  There is no permanent record in voting this way. This bill was rushed through voice votes. This should not have happened. It is the weakness of the chairman and this bill was too important to be treated this way.<br><br>10. Eight MP&#39;s  were suspended from Parliament that day. This left the house empty. 15 bills were passed through parliament in the absence of these suspended MP&#39;s because the opposition was eliminated.<br><br>This is not democracy. It is no where near democracy. The PM has a lot to answer for.","{'document_tone': {'tones': [{'score': 0.547551, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}]}, 'sentences_tone': [{'sentence_id': 0, 'text': 'Delhi Parliament
