"Dear india Today team,   Its simple example like..     Government Schools and between private schools, the  government school everyone knew the situations.  and   Same like situation will be market yard in the  future , if these ordinance not cancel.  Everyone should understand. Its not only farmers War.  If any company purchased 100ton Wheet  less then MSP.  AND they stocks in the warehouse and after some time in the market they will sale on high price.  It will effect on consumers also. Because consumers pay high rates. The company will not sale to consumer direct. the company will sale to modern trade and modern trade will tag  his price on that product.  So everyone should understand , the situation will be massive in future,  the    poor people cannot survive.  Farmer in loss and consumer also in loss.  The Profit only companies will get,  who was purchased and stock's.  The all media staff also in  consumer que ,  please spread the truth ðŸ™�   Thanks",2020-12-03T20:05:46+0000,0.126,0.05,0.824,0.915
"In haryana mandis are the structure made by govt. This is a system to help poor farmers as well rich farmers.in mandis ardti (middle man) work for 2 percent of his commissions in exchange he provide us services that need to be done before selling cleaning, packing, payment from purchaser and place to store our crops before selling. Second thing families which are rely only on farmering need financial need for upto 4 to 6 months( crop cycle). If any financial crisis and any unplanned thing happen to them they easily Can take their help as they are their clients in exchange of verbel security of next crop. So exploitation of farmers are happening in states with weak mandi system and bad govt purchase. Prices of every product depends on demand and supply. As u seen several time prices of vegetables and grans. Govt need to assure minimum support price in writing and maximum selling price also which will be a strong step to stop corporate monopoly as they have sell products made of farming in balances price",2020-12-04T16:23:43+0000,0.119,0.085,0.797,0.7184
