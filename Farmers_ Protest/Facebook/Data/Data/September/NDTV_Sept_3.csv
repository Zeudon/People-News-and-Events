These Farm Bills were passed without any debate, without any select committee  approval, without any discussions with Farmers or their Representatives.  The two bills are: 1. The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Bill   Simply put, this bill allows farmers to sell their produce to private players who are then allowed to stock and sell it into the market as per their business strategies.   2. The Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services   This bill allows Corporates to get into agreements of Corporate Farming with the farmers directly.   What these bills basically do is it reduces the importance of APMC, removes the middle men in the Farmer to APMC transactions and allows Corporates to buy and sell as per their business goals.   Sounds Good?   Sure.... Why not.... But......   These bills come with underlying assumptions:   That the Corporates will work on minimum profits and pass the cost savings made by the elimination of the middle men to the consumers and the farmers equally.   That the Corporates will not monopolize farming, making the farmer into nothing more than a contract laborer in his own fields.  That the Corporates will not arm twist the farmers into selling on reduced low to zero profit rates once such monopolies are established.   That the loose grains which come into the market at your Kiranawalas right now will not be made extinct and the consumers will end up buying only packaged food grains under the Corporate labels with them dictating the final MRP.   That the Corporates will not hoard foodgrains and essentials to create artificial scarcity in the market thus driving the sales price skywards when it suits them.  Not so surprisingly the only ones laughing their way to the bank will be the Corporates...... Again!!!   Disclaimer:  If you believe that all these assumptions are true and will be implemented to the letter, then I am sure you also believe in Ache Din Aayenge, 2000 notes had a nano chip and Santa Claus exists.  ~ Darshan Mondkar",2020-09-20T14:59:21+0000,0,0,
