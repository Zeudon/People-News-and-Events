First law: *Legalized Hoarding*. Now Big Fish/Crony capitalists can hoard as much as they can/want. Govt can step in only during War or Calamity. Items like Onions and Tomatoes are no more ‘essential commodities’.  So big corporate hoarders will create artificial gluts to buy cheaply from the farmers. And then create artificial scarcity to sell dearly to the end-consumers. So basically a lose-lose situation for both farmers and consumers, and a win-win situation for the crony capitalists.   2. Second Law: *Farmer can sell any where to any one with PAN Card* So basically the entire Agricultural Infrastructure and Mandis of Punjab, Haryana and Western UP go for a six!  It’s only due to the Transaction fee/cess on sale of crops, that roads get built in rural Punjab by the Mandi Board. Without this, the state governments have no other source of income to build rural roads.  Ahrtias provide year-around, collateral-free credit to the farmers. With these anti-farmer laws, the Ahrtias will soon vanish and so will this easy credit system for the farmer.  Only 4% of Indian Farmers get MSP (and assured government procurement). Other 96% dont get it. That's why UP & Bihar farmers do labour in Punjab and Haryana. Now Modi government wants the farmers of Punjab and Haryana also to become migrants labourers.  GOI does procurement of only 2 items on MSP (wheat and rice). Though it issues MSP list for 20 odd items. Slowly GOI, will announce MSP, but will no longer be duty bound to procure wheat and rice. So Govt Godowns, Silos and FCI would also go for a six.  The most nonsensical clause is that the farmer can sell their crop anywhere. So a Punjabi farmer will hire cargo aircrafts and take his wheat and rice to Tamilnadu/Gujarat??? Obviously not! This clause is only for the benefit of big corporates, who will manipulate the markets/prices and sell wherever they would want.  3. The next ordinance: *Contract Farming* Big Sharks/corporates will take land on contract (which will only safeguard the interests and profit motive of big corporates). The farmer will become Mazdoor on his own land. Produce will be packaged attractively and will be sold at high prizes. All humans who depend on farm produce will be the suckers. The rural economy of the country will totally collapse.  Remember how Jio internet was free for 1 year? When you got hooked, it was Rs 199 and now Rs 350. Zor ka jhatka dheere se lage! The same will happen to farmers.  USA has mere 2% farmers and Europe has just 1%. On the other hand India has 76%! Corporates require labour. From where can they get that much labour?  From ‘defarming’ that 76% to more manageable percentage. So Modi ji is doing the needful!  These Ordinances were brought in on June 05 2020 under Article 123 of Indian Constitution. Which says emergency legislation can be passed as Ordinance when Parliament is not in session. Can some wise guy tell what was the emergency during Covid period??? And that too when lndia’s GDP has fallen by -30%!  But the Indian voters have been kept distracted by Rhea, Kangana and now Deepika! Modi ko to bass apne political financiers (Ambanis aur Adani) ko khush karna hai, desh ka kissan jaye bhad mei’n!  #AntiFarmerLaws",2020-09-25T03:24:38+0000,10,12,
