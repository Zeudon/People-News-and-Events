Flower exports has to be incentivised.  Bio fuel like Jatropa can be cultivated, it will be good for rural hotel & house kitchen fire. Farmers dependence on MSP will reduce.

At the Farmer's agitation site, all type of men & machinerie jbs, including Chapati, Poori making machines in bulk quantities are deployed like in a War site, to feed the farmers day night. As per various media reports Tones of food stuffs are available with or assured from sources to continue the strike even for one year... It is much pride for we Indians to know that our Farmers are such an economically powerful Farmers... So it is now confirmed that our Farmers are so much wealthy and self reliant that they can sit on Strike for months without doing any farming works..  During Shahinbaug strike also the participants were provided with food and shelter round the clock without any fund shortage... But during the Covid lock down period thousanda of migrant labours and their families walked hundred of kilometers by road and through available vehicles.. There were no one from these facilitators seen anywhere to feed them a one time food to these poor migrants..  Now Kejriwal is is arranging shelter and Food to the striking farmers, why he has not provided such facilities to the poor labours...  Even an higher rank IT professional cannot afford to live with out a month's salary.. Also in India about 95 % of farmres are very poor who are not able to live their life without farming even for a month....   **And here in strike venu at Singhu site, five star menu foods including Badaam, Pista,Kismis, Cashew nuts, Butter, Milk etc are serving round the clock..* About six months stock of above food stuffs are stocked there..Thousands of Expensive overcoats to fight the cold are stocked there, also thousands of Tracters and other expensive vehicles are parked there  to meet six months requirements which gives a common man of the feeling that this is not a Farmer's strike but seems to be a war against an elected government...  Here is another twist of fate, an irony of fate in India. A 2% lobby is holding 98% against the wall. Strange country strange people. Holding the Govt. at ransom only for political reasons.   After giving written assurances, farmers should accept and end the agitation. This is blackmail tactics by a motivated group. The way of functioning of the agitation itself now reveals the country that, this is not a movement of Farmers. Why can't Congress and Left leaders leave Farmers and Govt. alone. The masks over the faces of the opposition itself telling the truth....  Please forward as much as possible for awareness of the comm man and to expose these failed leaders whose main aim is to to destabilize the country....",2020-12-15T00:58:16+0000,1,1,

THE FARMER AND YOU Long ago did the brown Earth  Open it's heart in a brown smile And brown men walked in it Singing Earth songs awhile   They tilled the brown land And then slept in her arms The Mother gave a bounty To her brown heart's sons  A sickle and a plough And some seeds of hope, For a much-awaited harvest Were the mighty Gods invoked  Then skywards they gazed At the July sun for rain For there's a season of fear Before every shred of grain  It's a labor of patience It’s a labor of unequalled love For who knows the Earth As her brown son does?  For every grain that comes to town Are eons of their forefather's skills And fervent prayers of brown people Before it reaches all your mills  The grain sits on your table now You touch it with wry nonchalance You consume it without gratitude As you consume everything else  Monsters of mindless consuming Haven’t you now become? Making Gods of Malls and Money And treating the Life Giver as dust  Tear Gas and Water Cannons?! On frail old men in the Northern Cold?! The fall of a great civilization In its conscience that you sold  The Earth is turned to poison So the new monsters can live Extracting from the poor Mother Much more than she can give  But isn't the Earth one great being? And each small being just a part? If its brown sons suffer to death Wont the rest just fall apart?  Or white men have you become now? While brown men till the Earth? You replaced the old oppressors With the new, which you've become  “Bharat Mata Ki Jai!”  Your screeching oft' heard cry! You forsake Earth's brown sons And leave them there to die  Either,  Speak now, the time is ripe! For under that borrowed white  You too were once Earth born Sons of the same brown soil   Or,  Close your white heart and consume The grains with their sweat and soil, ground But with every grain that you eat now You consume their congealed blood, brown  #sajlachawlapoetry",2020-12-18T11:57:33+0000,0,0,

Agar aap sahi ho to why are u not answering questions from farmers....they are the reason we all are able to procure food items!!! India being predominantly agricultural country can't you once come to a middle ground and settle this dispute!!! Not expected this from u!!! I always respected you as one of the best PM of India...but slowly it feels as if you have decided to blindfold urself from true concerns that's happening!!!,2020-12-15T05:01:19+0000,3,1,
