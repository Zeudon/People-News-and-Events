Moreover, the Corona Virus is wreaking havoc. And now this agitation, causing further chaos and problems. *The innocent and gullible farmers are being made to believe that the Bills passed are against them, which in fact are in their favour, for their welfare and betterment. *Who is spreading false information to the Farmers? It is headed by Congress and their tout Amarinder Singh sitting in Punjab. And they are joined in by the anti national, anti India elements, by the Tukda Party Leaders in India, by Khalistan supporters in India and abroad (particularly Canada), by Muslims who are anti India, by Pakistani and Chinese supporters. *Have the Sikhs forgotten that it was the Congress Party that caused the mass massacre of the Sikhs and destroyed the Golden Temple? *Have the Farmers forgotten that Punjab itself is undergoing through extreme crises due to drugs. *At this juncture, I suggest that the strict measures taken by the Government. All the numerous benefits provided to the farmers must be withdrawn (except to the poor farmers). Farmers who come in the tax slab must pay income tax. *Wherever the farmers are sitting on demonstration, a thorough check for illegal arms and ammunition and drugs should be made. *Section 144 of CrPC must be immediately put into effect. *Farmers have said that they will do Bharat Bandh in a few days. Government must try to make the farmers understand that the Bills that have been passed are in their favour and they should exercise restraint. But if everything fails and the farmers continue with their ill conceived notion, then I suggest that National Emergency must be put into effect. Because it would amount to creating tension in our country and an attempt to destabilize our country. *All protesters must be scrutinised and the bad elements such as Khalistan and Pakistan supporters should be arrested. Pro Khalistan elements in Canada should not be allowed entry into India.  *BJP and Narendra Modi Government is a Government that believes in taking action, and they must take action. *All the knowledgeable and educated citizens of India fully support and stand with the Government. I stand against anyone, be it the external or internal enemy of my country without any fear and with full conviction. Jai Hind Vande Mataram Bharat Mata Ki Jai ????????",2020-12-04T20:04:38+0000,9,5,
