(People tell me to keep quiet, to keep my opinion to myself, even abuse me and threaten me. But I won't stay quiet. This is my country too, and if something wrong is happening in my country, I won't stop until everything is okay. For me my Country always comes first. I never blindly follow the crowd. I think. I think rationally, and do the thing that is Right. I strongly condemn the farmers' acts, completely disagree with them, and totally oppose them)  ?? Farmers had started their Agitation as they didn't trust the Government's intentions regarding the 3 Bills. Now the Government has assured the Farmers that the Bills have been passed for their benefit, and have also given the same in written. But now the farmers have come up with a new demand. A demand to repeal the Bills altogether. Although it's not going to happen, but just in case Government repeals the 3 Bills, what if tomorrow the Farmers come up with some new self made Laws/Bills and pressurise the Government to pass them?! Isn't this a mockery of the Government, the whole system and doesn't it reflects malicious intentions? I hope that now everyone understands that who's calling the shots here.  Read on....  ???? The farmers' protest has never been a farmers' protest. Although the Farmers are participating in the protest, but in reality Farmers have nothing to do with these protests. From the very beginning it was the Congress Party that made Farmers into believing, misleading them, misinforming them that the Bills passed by the Government are against the welfare of Farmers. The Bills were actually One Hundred Percent in the favour for the benefit of Farmers. The Congress Party did so just for making political gains. Then slowly all the anti BJP, anti Indian Government Political Parties at the State Level saw this as a great opportunity and jumped in with the Congress Party to spread lies to the Farmers. Unfortunately, because the Indian Farmers are innocent and gullible, they fell in the trap laid by all these Political Parties. The Farmers' Protest has over 90 percent farmers who are from the State of Punjab. That's because Punjab is ruled by the Congress Party. The rest of the Farmers are from the States which are headed by non BJP Parties or those Farmers in BJP ruled States who don't support the BJP Party. Finally, the so called Farmers' Protest has been joined in by Pro Khalistanis in India and particularly in Canada(they are also funding the farmers' protest), UK & USA, by Pro Pakistanis, by Muslims who are anti India, by Anti India and Anti BJP elements. These anti India elements have given a religious colour to the Farmers' protest. They are the ones who are taking the shots, misguiding the farmers. They are spreading lies and hatred amongst the farmers. They are trying to create division/a divide amongst the citizens of India. These anti India and anti Indian Government elements are preaching the Farmers that the Government in the Centre and the Prime Minister Modi is Pro Hindus and anti Sikhs (and anti Muslims)(which is the biggest lie because Mr. Modi is a secular leader and is working for the benefit of all Indians. PM Modi and BJP have always distanced themselves from the ideologies of RSS). They are telling the Sikhs that Hindus are their enemy and that the Sikhs are better people than the Hindus in every manner. They are trying to create communal disharmony in India with an attempt to destabilize India and the Indian Government. So it would not be wrong to say that this was never a Farmers' Protest but an attempt by the anti BJP, anti India, anti Indian Government, anti Indian Elements to harm our Country and Her Citizens. And for this the Farmers of our country have been used as a weapon. And the Farmers don't have the slightest idea that they are being played with.  I ASK THE FARMERS TO STOP THE AGITATION IMMEDIATELY. YOU HAVE ALREADY CAUSED IMMENSE UNNECESSARY TROUBLE FOR INDIA, THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY THE COMMON INDIAN CITIZENS. YOU HAVE MALIGNED THE IMAGE OF OUR COUNTRY INTERNATIONALLY. YOU HAVE ALREADY CROSSED ALL THE LIMITS. SO FAR THE CITIZENS OF INDIA HAD SYMPATHY FOR YOU. DON'T LET THAT SYMPATHY TURN INTO ANGER. BELIEVE ME THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE ANGER OF ALL THE OTHER COMMON CITIZENS OF INDIA IF THEY COME UP TOGETHER AND TAKE A STAND AGAINST YOU. TRUST THE GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THESE BILLS ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FOR YOUR WELFARE AND BENEFIT. NOW STOP THIS MISCHIEF BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST!  ?? I am extremely saddened by the current state of events in India. It's been 73 years since Independence, but still majority of the Indian population is highly ignorant and lack common sense (Bhed Chaal). They cannot think independently and are unable to see the truth beyond all the lies and deceit. They are as vulnerable to anti national elements as they were when the British ruled India. All the anti India elements cannot see India & Indians progressing, developing fast into a Superpower, a developed country, an advanced country. They want to see India & Indians to remain poor and backward. How can they achieve this goal of theirs? It's very easy. Divide and Rule! Just create a divide amongst the citizens of India. That simple! Eat popcorns and watch Indians fight amongst themselves and see India burning.  ?? The anti India elements(inside and outside India) have come up together and joined hands to weaken India. They are always on the prowl looking for opportunities so as succeed in their ill intentions. Now is the time for the Citizens of India to join hands, to come together, stand unitedly like a wall, to take a vow to not fall prey to their antics, to love each other, to appreciate the similarities and respect the differences, to do everything for the betterment and welfare of their country, and to make India a Great Country that one day the whole world will look upto with great admiration, respect and honour.
