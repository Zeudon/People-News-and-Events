"Living long past retirement years is a travail by itself and one usually gets affected by ailments. There&#39;s no gain saying it. However, there&#39;s a law which has to be enforced.

Stan Swamy supported it for political gains of the deprived who remained so over 70-years when taxpayer money was pillaged by governments of the day. This aspect missed the bus in Stan Swamy&#39;s thoughts and irrationality became a fodder for his pronouncements.

"What did the State gain by murdering Fr. Stan Swamy? <br><br><br>   Fr. Stan Swamy was a humanitarian and a man of God whom our government could not treat with humanity. He was not a part of the Bhima-Koregaon violence and had been arrested by the NIA (National Intelligence Agency) in a dubious case of the Elgar Parishad violence. He will live in our hearts as a hero, the brave dissenter who stood against the fascist Modi government at the cost of his life. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have Fr. Stan Swamy&#39;s blood on their hands. The country will never forgive them. The death of Fr. Stan Swamy on July 5 will haunt the Indian judiciary forever. May his soul rest in peace.<br>   Fr. Stan Swamy wouldn&#39;t have survived for long. It was inevitable. His death was a murder and nothing else.<br>   But the prolonged torture Fr. Stan Swamy faced at his age and in his condition, even in the face of all the protests, was deliberately imposed by the State, and done so defiantly, blatantly, and openly to make a point and an example. It was premeditated. And it was bloody-minded malice baring its fangs from the highest level.<br>   But Stan Swamy&#39;s defiance was of an epic level. He stuck to his convictions to the very last. All the might and power of the State could not break an 84 year old man with so many ailments infected by    Covid.<br>   He won in the end. And like Gladys Staines, the widow of the late Graham Staines who was burnt alive along with his two sons, I am sure he was true to his faith by forgiving his oppressors.<br>   What did the State achieve by murdering<br>Fr. Stan Swamy?",2021-07-07T09:29:21Z,0.116,0.131,0.753,-0.2123
